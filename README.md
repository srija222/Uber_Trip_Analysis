# Uber_Trip_Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes Uber trip data and applies machine learning models to forecast daily demand.
The dataset (Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL.csv) contains historical Uber trip records, which were cleaned, explored, and modeled to uncover demand trends and predict future trips.

The goal is to understand temporal travel patterns and build predictive models that can support business decisions such as driver allocation, surge pricing, and operations planning.

‚öôÔ∏è Workflow

Data Loading & Cleaning
Robust loading of raw CSV with encoding handling.
Automatic detection of date and trip count columns.
Conversion to daily time series.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Daily demand trend visualization.
Weekday vs weekend demand analysis.
Seasonal decomposition to detect weekly patterns.

Supervised Learning Setup

Created lag features (past 7 days ‚Üí predict next day).
Train/test split (80/20, time-based).

Modeling

Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
XGBoost Regressor (if available)
Ensemble model (weighted average of predictions).

Evaluation

Metrics: MSE, R¬≤, and MAPE.
Plots comparing Actual vs Predicted trips.

Results & Outputs

Saved trained models (.pkl).
Saved predictions (predictions_test.csv).

üîé Key Insights

Clear weekly seasonality (weekday vs weekend demand).
Gradient Boosting outperformed Random Forest, but the ensemble model gave the most stable predictions.
Models captured long-term trends but struggled with sudden spikes (holidays, events).

‚úÖ Conclusion

The project demonstrates how Uber trip data can be used for demand forecasting.
By combining machine learning models with time series analysis, we can build systems that help optimize driver allocation, surge pricing, and customer experience.

üöÄ Future Improvements

Add external features (weather, holidays, events).
Perform spatial analysis by zones.
Use deep learning models (LSTM, Prophet).
Build a real-time dashboard for monitoring demand forecasts.
